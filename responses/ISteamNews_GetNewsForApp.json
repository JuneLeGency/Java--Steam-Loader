        "contents": "<p></p>\n<p>Do you enjoy playing ranked matches in Dota 2? Well, you better have a phone number ready because you&apos;re not going to be able to do that for much longer without one. Valve has announced in a <a href=\"http://blog.dota2.com/2017/04/matchmaking-update/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that it&apos;s now requiring all players to register a unique phone number if they want to play in ranked matches.</p><p>Valve is adding this requirement to reduce the number of players who use multiple accounts in ranked, saying it creates &quot;a negative matchmaking experience at all skill brackets.&quot; Requiring a unique phone number for each ranked account will ideally prevent a noticeable number of players from doing this, resulting in a positive effect from players using their primary accounts.</p><p>If you&apos;re upset by this news and refuse to adhere to Valve&apos;s new rule, then you have until May 4 to enjoy all the ranked matchmaking you possibly can. After that, accounts without a unique phone number will not be eligible to participate in ranked matches.&#xA0;</p><p>This is similar to what Valve has done with <a href=\"https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2235-QYCN-3295\">CS:GO&apos;s Prime Matchmaking</a>, which offers higher quality matchmaking if you&apos;ve registered a phone number. However, in that game, regular ranked play is still available without a phone.</p><p>Removing a number from your Dota 2 account after registration brings about a couple things. You can add a new number right away, but the number that was removed will not be usable for three months. Valve says this is to prevent someone from removing a number and immediately registering it with their alternate account. On top of that, Valve is not allowing numbers from online services to be registered. That means you likely won&apos;t be able to use your Google Voice number.</p><p>You can read the <a href=\"http://blog.dota2.com/2017/04/matchmaking-update/\" target=\"_blank\">full blog post here</a>, which goes into a number of other changes, including party changes, the return of ranked solo queue, and improved handling of nefarious behavior.</p>",

All the details on this weekend&#x2019;s events can be found below.</p><p><strong>League of Legends: 2017 EU LCS Spring Split Finals</strong></p><p>Two-time defending EU LCS champions G2 Esports secured three straight wins against Fnatic in the semifinals last Saturday, winning the series and taking a spot in this weekend&#x2019;s finals. Fnatic didn&#x2019;t go down without a fight and they caught G2 off-guard in game one with aggressive roaming and early lane swaps, but G2 played safe and punished Fnatic&#x2019;s over-aggressive plays. Meanwhile, Unicorns of Love took down Misfits in a tense 3-1 series. The final game saw UOL secure an early lead thanks to an explosive play in the bot lane, which gave them a 3-1 lead. UOL used this power advantage to quickly barrage Misfits&#x2019; bot-lane and secure a quick 23-minute victory.

Both teams will play in Vancouver this Saturday and TSM will face Cloud9, while FlyQuest will play in the third place match against Phoenix1 in the finals. The series saw both teams pick strong team fighting compositions, but TSM had a better frontline which they used to tank FlyQuest&#x2019;s damage and snag objectives for a decisive sweep. The semifinal series for Cloud9 was also a one-sided affair as they dominated Phoenix1 in a quick 3-0 series. Cloud9 matched P1 point for point, but they always had the advantage in every skirmish. Phoenix1 desperately tried to make a comeback, but Cloud9&#x2019;s superiority was shown in game three when they only gave up one tower and three kills.
